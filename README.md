### **Part 1: Energy Grid Analytics**

**Real-time electricity generation monitoring and forecasting for the UK national grid.**

Features:
- Live generation data by fuel type (coal, gas, nuclear, wind, solar, etc.)
- Time series forecasting with Prophet
- Renewable energy percentage tracking and analysis
- Interactive visualizations showing generation mix over time
- Historical trend analysis and pattern detection

Data source: Elexon Portal API (official UK electricity market data)

### **Part 2: MLOps Infrastructure**

**Production monitoring and model management system.**

Features:
- MLflow experiment tracking and model registry
- Data drift detection with Evidently AI
- Prometheus + Grafana monitoring dashboards
- Automated model retraining pipelines
- CI/CD with GitHub Actions
- Containerized deployment with Docker

Demonstrates production ML best practices: model versioning, performance monitoring, automated alerting, and reproducible pipelines.
